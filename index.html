    <h1>Privacy and Politics Document for UFRGS I3 App</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document outlines the privacy and political aspects of the "UFRGS I3" app. The app's primary function is to calculate the harmonic average of student grades based on user inputs. It is designed with a strong commitment to user privacy and does not require internet access or the use of personal information.</p>

    <h2>Privacy Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> The app collects the minimum necessary information to perform its intended function. It only takes user input in the form of grade values for calculation.</li>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> The app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information such as names, email addresses, or any other identifiable information.</li>
        <li><strong>Offline Functionality:</strong> The app operates entirely offline, ensuring that user data stays within the device and is not transmitted over the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Permissions:</strong> The app only requests permissions required for its core functionality. It does not request unnecessary access to device resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Handling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Inputs:</strong> The app allows users to input their grade values for calculation purposes. These inputs are exclusively used to perform the harmonic average calculation and are not associated with any user identification.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculation Process:</strong> The app processes user input within the device itself to calculate the harmonic average. The calculation does not involve any external data sources or remote servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> The app does not store any user input data or calculated results. Once the calculation is completed, all data related to the session is cleared from the app's memory.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Security Measures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> While the app does not handle sensitive information, it utilizes encryption techniques to secure the app's code and data storage, ensuring that the app's functionality cannot be compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> The app's codebase is regularly updated to address any security vulnerabilities that may arise.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Integration:</strong> The app does not integrate with any third-party services or libraries that could potentially compromise user data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Transparency</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> The app's source code is made available for public review to ensure transparency and to allow security experts to assess its functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> A clear and concise privacy policy is provided within the app, explaining the data handling practices and the app's commitment to user privacy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Political Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Sovereignty:</strong> The app respects the principles of data sovereignty by ensuring that user data remains within the user's control and is not transferred to external servers or entities.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Use:</strong> The app is designed for educational purposes and encourages the ethical use of technology for academic improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> The app is intended to be accessible and useful for all users, regardless of their backgrounds, and does not discriminate based on any factors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The UFRGS I3 app prioritizes user privacy, data security, and ethical considerations. By adhering to strict privacy principles, the app ensures that user data remains protected and that the app's functionality aligns with user expectations. This document serves as a testament to the app's commitment to privacy and responsible technology use.</p>
